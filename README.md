Javascript for data visualisation

Using the D3 techniques, this script will create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. 

* State abbreviations are included in the circles.

* Note: You'll need to use `python -m http.server` to run the visualisation. This will host the page at `localhost:8000` in your web browser.
